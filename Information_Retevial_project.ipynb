    "In our business category, we expect the TF-IDF model to effectively highlight the importance of key terms related to financial policies and sustainable development. This model will help us identify relevant documents that align closely with our specific interests and needs.\n",

    "Document 1: Discusses recent developments in indirect tax and service tax rates in Malaysia.\n",
    "Document 2: Provides an overview of Malaysia's economic outlook and trade transactions.\n",

    "The query we are examining is: \"Budget principles for sustainable development Malaysia.\" This query is particularly relevant to our corpus, as it directly aligns with the themes present in Document 4, which addresses budgetary frameworks and sustainability. By preprocessing the documents and calculating their TF-IDF values, we will be able to assess the relevance of each document to our query using cosine similarity scores. This approach will facilitate efficient document retrieval based on our specific search criteria."
