# Information-Retrieval-Project
This project implements Information Retrieval techniques to process, index, and retrieve relevant information from datasets. It focuses on text preprocessing, query matching, and evaluation of retrieval performance.

---
## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).  
- Building an inverted index.  
- Query processing and matching.  
- Evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F-measure.  

---

## Results
The notebook demonstrates:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).  
- Building an inverted index.  
- Query matching and evaluation.

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook *Information_Retevial_project.ipynb* and run the cells to view the code and results.
